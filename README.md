## Introduction

This is a Monitoring system made with PHP, using Zend Expressive micro-framework.

It's goal is to monitor servers and services in distributed systems, like in a micro service architeture.

## Usage

You can use this module to collect data from:
* [Athena](https://github.com/Lansoweb/athena): To monitor the servers and it's services
* [Cerberus](https://github.com/Lansoweb/cerberus): To monitor the services availability
* [Hermes](https://github.com/Lansoweb/hermes): To monitor the services response times and trace requests through micro-services

The data is displayed as dashboards and can be fetched via REST API.

You can create alarms based on the data collected from the services.
